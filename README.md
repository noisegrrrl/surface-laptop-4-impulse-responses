# surface-laptop-4-impulse-responses

Impulse Responses for the Surface Laptop 4 made following the [HeSuVi tutorial](https://sourceforge.net/p/hesuvi/wiki/How-To%20Record%20Impulse%20Responses%20Digitally/)

The final IRs are in the `14 Channels IRs` folder.

There are two versions, one with only the Realtek Audio Enhancements and the other with both the Realtek Audio Enhancements and Dolby Atmos activated.
There is no version with Dolby Atmos alone as the Impulse Response was not usable.

For global sound quality, it seems like the Realtek Audio Enhancements have the most impact, Dolby Atmos being barely noticeable during general use.
